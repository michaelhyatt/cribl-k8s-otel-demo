----

This is a demo pack for Cribl Search around demoing Otel and k8s


##  SETUP

Before you begin, ensure that you have met the following requirements:

* setup the otel demo with k8s, edge, stream, ngrok...[per the doc](https://github.com/michaelhyatt/cribl-k8s-otel-demo/tree/main)
* Change the macros *replayURL* within this pack : replace with your own ngrok URL, with double quotes : it should look like : "https://xxx.ngrok-free.dev"
* Make sure the dataset used are otel_logs, otel_metrics [per the doc](https://github.com/michaelhyatt/cribl-k8s-otel-demo/tree/main)
* For k8s logs : assign the datatype *oteldemo_K8s_logs* to the k8s dataset (should be k8s_logs and k8s_metrics)
* Once you receive Otel logs and traces in your dataset : run the threshold builder (in saved searches) : *otel_hourly_treshold_export* 

At this point the dashboard *Send only the slow traâ€¦sed sampling analyzer* should show a 99% reduction
